 # Ever got tired of Windows 10 updates? 
 Then this little tool is for you!
 
 By default, within windows update center you are able to delay updates up to a month (35 days) using "Pause updates" feature.
 
 #### That is what's about to be changed ;)
 
 Tool doesn't do much on it's own, it's basically a simple UI for a registry hack of delaying updates.
 In theory, updates can be delayed for any time you want.
 
 Also has a button of resuming updates and delaying them for 1 year, if the user is too lazy picking a date.

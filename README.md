 # Ever get tired of Windows 10 updates? 
 Then this little tool is for you!
 
 By default, withing windows update center you are able to delay windows updates up to a month. 
 *That what's about to be changed ;)
 
 Tool doesn't do much on it's own, it's basically a simple UI for a registry hack of delaying updates.
 In theory, updates can be delayed for any time you want.
 
 Also has a button of resuming updates and delaying them for 1 year, if the user is too lazy picking a date.
 
 # Have fun!
